Your application starts running inside the application master container. But what is the container? It is a set of resources that includes memory and CPU.

    For example, a yarn container may be a set of two CPU cores and four GB of memory. So whenever we refer to yarn container, you should think of a box of some CPU and memory. Make sense? Great. So we learned about the three components of Hadoob yarn. Yarn has three main components. Resource Manager, Node Manager and Application Master.

         things. I will start with an introduction to Hadoop and take you deep into Hadoop architecture. Then I will talk about some history and the origin of Hadoop. Hadoop became very popular, but we had many challenges with Hadoop. So I will talk about some challenges with the Hadoop platform. Finally, I will introduce you to Apache Spark and see how Spark overcomes those challenges. The last things in this lecture will give you an idea of where Hadoob stands in today's
