- Formed a cluster of computers
- Utilized combined capacity for storage
The transcript is too short and lacks context to provide a meaningful summary. From the given information, it can be inferred that the data was insufficient and a map reduction was also obtained.
1. The system enables the use of combined computing power of the cluster.
2. This combined power is used to produce enormous volumes of data.
- Data was stored in HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).
- This technology was considered revolutionary at the time.
- No need for expensive supercomputers 
- Large volumes of data can be stored and processed without them
1. Hadoob enables the combination of regular computers into a cluster.
2. This process creates storage.
- Computation capacity was required.
- This capacity enabled the collection and storage of a significant volume of data.
1. The discussion revolves around what existed before the introduction of STFS and MapReduce.
2. There is a mention of difficulties or impossibilities faced prior to these systems.
1. The discussion revolves around Terra data and XR data.
2. The main concern is understanding how to use these data warehouses.
1. Pipelines were created to collect data.
2. The data was sourced from numerous old systems.
3. The collected data was then transferred into the data warehouse.
1. The data was processed thoroughly.
2. Business insights were extracted from the data.
3. These insights were used to make appropriate business decisions.
- The subject matter is Hadoop.
- Hadoop promises to offer something that is being compared to another unspecified thing.
- The speaker does not provide specifics on what Hadoop's offerings are.
- An offer has been made to collect and process data.
- The goal of this process is to extract business insights.
- This is related to the advent of HIFS.
- Map Redoes began challenging data warehouses.
- The challenge is focused on three critical aspects.
- One of these aspects is increasing the capacity.
1. Scaling the HDFS and MapReduce can be easily achieved.
2. This is done by adding more inexpensive servers to the cluster.
1. The process of scaling the data warehouse system was complex.
2. This scaling process was also expensive.
3. The context involves Hadoob L.A, possibly a company or system.
1. The plan is to begin with a low-cost, small cluster.
2. There is an intention to add more low-priced servers as needed.
- There was a discussion about increasing capacity.
- The topic of data warehouses was brought up.
- There was a need to plan and strategize for data warehouses.
1. The capacity was increased in advance.
2. Increasing capacity at a later stage was considered complex.
3. The later increase in capacity was also expensive.
4. The process was time consuming.
- Data warehouses primarily support structured data.
- Some data warehouses also support dem- (the sentence is incomplete, full information not available).
1. The speaker appreciated the minimal support for structured data.
2. However, this support was not sufficient for their needs.
3. Hadoop was used to store a variety of data.
- The text discusses various types of data formats: text, JSON, XML.
- It also mentions different types of media: images, audio, videos.
- The phrase "and what not" suggests that there may be other types not specifically listed.
1. Hadoop provides support for a variety of data formats.
2. Data formats in Hadoop are often classified into three categories.
1. Discussion about different types of data: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured.
2. Mention of challenges faced by data warehouses.
- James Dixon, the CTO at Pentaho, coined a new name for the Hadoop approach.
The transcript discusses the concept of a "data lake". However, no specific details or explanations about how a data lake works were provided in the given text.
1. Data is collected from various sources.
2. The collected data is stored, similar to data warehouses.
1. Data was stored in HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).
2. MapReduce and Spark were utilized to process this data.
3. The processed data was used to prepare new data.
1. Models were discussed for generating reports and business insights.
2. The individual's park assumed control over the map retours and other tools over time.
- Spark was used to process and prepare the data.
- The data was prepared for recording.
1. The data was stored in data lake storage.
2. This storage was used for business intelligence and reporting purposes.
3. The BIN used was popular.
1. Rules were put in place to offer a connector for accessing data from the data lake.
2. The data lake allows for the collection and browsing of data.
1. There are large volumes of semi-structured and unstructured data.
2. This type of data is necessary for machine learning.
- Data lake empowers Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads.
- The concept of data lake was imagined with this capability in mind.
The provided text is insufficient to create a comprehensive summary. From the given information, the only key point that can be extracted is:

- Data lake technology was applied in the initial days of its evolution, but it missed two significant aspects. (The aspects are not specified in the provided text.)
- Data warehouses offer critical features
- These features include transaction and consistency.
- Data Lake had issues with proper support.
- Two of these issues were particularly significant, though unspecified in the provided text.
- Identified critical problems with the current system
- Started adopting a different architecture 
- This new architecture is specifically for implementing data lakes
1. Initiated integration of relational databases and data warehouses.
2. The integration is aimed at improving reporting and Business Intelligence (BI) purchases.
1. Data was collected and stored in a data lake.
2. The collected data was processed using Apache Spark.
3. The results of the processing were stored.
1. A data warehouse was established.
2. The Business Intelligence (BI) was connected and reported with the data warehouse.
3. Machine learning was implemented or discussed.
